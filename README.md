Contains my theoretical research papers on coded caching, distributed storage using linearized polynomials, and recent work on distributed computation with robustness against stragglers, byzantine servers, and honest but curious servers.
I plan to put implementations of my research on this repository, and other interesting readings on deep neural networks and other topics.
