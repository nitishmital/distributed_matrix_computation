Usage:

sage: load("<path_to_sage_file>/MBR_functional_regenerating_code.sage")
('initial evaluation points are linearly independent - ', True)

sage: helpers = [1,3,4,7]  # helper nodes
sage: newcmrs = [2,5]      # newcomer nodes
sage: repair(helpers,newcmrs)  # call function to repair the newcomers

### Verifying the linear independence of a set of evaluation points 

sage: vpoints = [nodes[j][i,0] for j in [4,5,6,7] for i in range(d)]  # list of all d points in each node 4,5,6,7
sage: verify_independence(vpoints)
False  
## Here it is false because r=2, and the set of points in nodes > r will have some linear dependence.

sage: vpoints = [nodes[j][i,0] for j in [1,5] for i in range(d)]   # list of all d points in r nodes (1,5)
sage: verify_independence(vpoints)
True
### true because the set of points in any r nodes are linearly independent
